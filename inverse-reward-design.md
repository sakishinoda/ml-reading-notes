[Inverse Reward Design](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.02827.pdf)
---

### Summary
- Motivated by reward misspecification: the reward provided to the agent are only observations from a "true" reward function, rarely applicable to all possible scenarios 
- Inverse reward design allows an agent to infer what the "true" reward function should be, given the observed reward function ("proxy") and the training MDP
- Inverse reward design (IRD) differs from inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), where approximately optimal behaviour (rather than the reward function) is observed
